        <h2>About the Industry</h2>
        <p>The healthcare industry is all about keeping people healthy and providing care to those in need. It includes hospitals, clinics, and other organizations that focus on treating patients and improving lives.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I work in healthcare administration, helping organize patient care, manage records, and make sure everything runs smoothly for both staff and patients.</p>

        <h2>Ethical Issue</h2>
        <p>One ethical issue in healthcare is keeping patient information private. Itâ€™s important to protect personal health details and only share them with authorized people.</p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
        <p>Two cybersecurity issues that can happen in healthcare are:</p>
        <p>1. Data breaches, where patient records are stolen or leaked.</p>
        <p>2. Ransomware attacks, where hackers lock systems until payment is made.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>To prevent these problems, healthcare workers should use strong passwords, avoid suspicious emails, and make sure data is backed up and encrypted.</p>
